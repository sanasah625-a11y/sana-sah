Hi, I'm Sana 👋  

I am an engineering student passionate about building real-world solutions at the
intersection of software, data, and hardware. I enjoy working with Python,
data analysis, and machine learning, and I have a strong interest in
embedded systems and VLSI fundamentals.

🔹 Currently learning & working on:
- Python for data analysis and automation
- Machine learning fundamentals and model building
- Embedded systems using sensors and microcontrollers
- Basics of VLSI, digital logic, and hardware design concepts

🔹 Areas of interest:
- Data-driven decision making
- Embedded and IoT-based applications
- Sensor data processing
- Hardware–software co-design

🔹 Goals:
- Build practical, well-documented projects
- Gain internship and freelance experience
- Develop strong foundations in ML, Embedded, and VLSI
- Grow into an applied engineer solving real-world problems
